We often think of busboys as the young people who remove our dirty dishes and reset the table, but they have many additional responsibilities. \\nA busboy's main job is to clean tables after guests leave. Busboys are often high-school students who are too young to work as bartenders or servers. Typically, they work their way up to the position of cook/chef or waiter/waitress. \\nBusboys will spend most of their shift cleaning tables. This involves waiting for those at the table to finish eating, then clearing all of the dirty plates, glasses and silverware into a tub. The busboy then wipes down and sanitizes the table, as well as vacuums or sweeps the floor and chairs to clean up any food spills. The busboy must also supply the table with new silverware, place mats and napkins. \\nSome busboys must empty all of the filled trash cans and replace the used bags. They must bring filled bags to a dumpster or trash compactor. Garbage is often heavy, so busboys should have good physical stamina. \\nSome busboys are responsible not only for clearing dishes and silverware from the table, but for washing them as well. This may involve hand washing or using a dishwasher. Dried dishes must then be put away in the proper location. Also, if there are any spills in the kitchen or dining room, busboys are usually the ones to mop them up. \\nWhen a restaurant is very busy, busboys must often help seat and serve customers drinks and appetizers. This requires that busboys are prompt and friendly, so having good people skills is a must for the job.\",\n",

Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – and each position contributes to making that possible for our guests. At our hotels, Runners work across departments to ensure that guests and associates have what they need at the point in time when they need it. Whether delivering items directly to guests in their room or providing support to housekeeping, engineering, banquets, restaurants, the front office, or other areas that need assistance, our Runners move about their space to get the job done. They are critical to ensure smooth operations throughout the entire hotel.\\nNo matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – ensuring a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Runners will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; move through narrow, confined, or elevated spaces as well as up and down stairs and/or service ramps), ensure they have what they need to do their work (read and visually verify information in a variety of formats, including small print; visually inspect tools, equipment, or machines), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 55 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all of these things well, and other reasonable job duties as requested, is critical for Runners – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.\\nMarriott International is an equal opportunity employer.

Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – and each position contributes to making that possible for our guests. At our hotels, Runners work across departments to ensure that guests and associates have what they need at the point in time when they need it. Whether delivering items directly to guests in their room or providing support to housekeeping, engineering, banquets, restaurants, the front office, or other areas that need assistance, our Runners move about their space to get the job done. They are critical to ensure smooth operations throughout the entire hotel.\\n\\n\\nNo matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – ensuring a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Runners will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; move through narrow, confined, or elevated spaces as well as up and down stairs and/or service ramps), ensure they have what they need to do their work (read and visually verify information in a variety of formats, including small print; visually inspect tools, equipment, or machines), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 55 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all of these things well, and other reasonable job duties as requested, is critical for Runners – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarriott International is an equal opportunity employer.
